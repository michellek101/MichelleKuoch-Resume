        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hey everyone my name is Michelle Kuoch, I am a first-year college student at the University of California Riverside.  I am majoring in Pre-Business and plan on continuing my career as an accountant.   I wanted to pursue this field of business because my older brother had taken this route in business so I want to continue that path as well.  He showed me that this is a field that I belong in so I decided to chase my dreams and work up to that dream.  Although this field of business is somewhat of a sit-down job, I consider this something easy that I could do in the future.  Not only that I want to be able to have freedom in my personal and business life.  In the summer of 2023 or 2024, I hope to find an internship in this career path so I can gain more experience and knowledge.  I want to be able to support my family in the future with this career as well because they’ve done so much for me. ,<br><br>

        During my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and family.  I enjoy hanging out with the people I love the most because they make me the happiest and inspire me to work harder every day.  Some of my hobbies include the gym, cars, and music.  I use the gym as a relaxing method because I feel good and refreshed after a good workout from a long stressful day.  After a long productive day, I want to finish off with an activity I enjoy the most.   I also enjoy the idea of cars because my family is highly interested in cars which made me become a car person as well.  Throughout my childhood, I was always so fascinated by the thought of cars and now that I’m older I want to work hard so that I can reward myself with the car that I wanted as a little girl.  Lastly, I love music as well.  I enjoy listening to music the most because it is comforting to hear as I do my homework.  I feel like music is the main factor in most of my problems today because I’m able to set myself free and enjoy what music has to offer.  <br><br>

        Throughout my years in high school, I’ve worked at places such as Kumon and my parent's donut shop.  Both were part-time jobs and I was able to balance my school work with this as well.  My first job was working at my parent's donut shop and it was one of the best experiences I could get because I was able to gain so many new traits that would help me in the future.  I gained lots of customer service skills and I was able to work with the food as well.  The donut shop was always busy with customers every day so I grew comfortable with the environment as the years went on.  This job at the donut shop really helped influence my work ethic at Kumon as well.  It was a job where I was able to help students and parents.
